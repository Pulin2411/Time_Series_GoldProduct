# Gold Price Prediction Model

## ✨ Overview

Welcome to the Gold Price Prediction Model repository!  
This project leverages **real-time financial data** and robust **time series analysis** to forecast gold prices, delivering actionable insights for investors, analysts, and financial enthusiasts.

## 🚀 What’s Inside

- **Comprehensive Data Pipeline:** Monthly gold price data fetched from yFinance (2005–2025).
- **Advanced Models:** ARIMA and SARIMA for high-accuracy time series forecasting.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Trend analysis, diagnostics, and forecast evaluation.
- **Live Demo:** Deployed via Streamlit for instant hands-on exploration.

## 📈 Key Features

- **Data Source:** yFinance (GC=F), ensuring reliable and up-to-date market information.
- **Models Used:** 
  - ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
  - SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
- **Easy Deployment:** Hosted on Streamlit for real-time user interaction.
- **Open Source:** Clean, modular codebase for easy collaboration and extension.
